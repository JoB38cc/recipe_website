    <h2>About The Recipe:</h2>
    <p>Falafel, or ta'ameya as we call in Egypt, is an all-time favorite street food. In most parts of the Middle East, falafel is made with ground chickpeas. However, in Egypt, we make it with dried fave beans. They are best served with pita bread, tomato, onions, and tahini sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried split fave beans</li>

        <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 cup sesame seeds(Optional)</li>
